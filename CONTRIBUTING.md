# Contributing to spmssite

We welcome Pull Requests for Issues and also discussions especially for things that are not necessarily issues with the code, especially questions and ideas.

Contributing to this site template assumes you know the basics of:

HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript / ECMAScript ES2018 or latest (minimum ES5)
PHP 8.1
Ajax
jQuery 3.6

## Editor / IDE

You are welcome to use any editor or IDE to contribute to this template website.  I have added .vscode folder which contains json files which configure VSCode for this project as I have seen that Visual Studio Code is among the top 5 most popular editors and including these files would help a developer get going easier. Please also feel free to test these and contribute to make the settings better.  

I realize that it's not a great idea to include configs and settings to source control but it might be helpful to some that are new and do not have yet configured their environment well enough for web development.

I have added .editorconfig and .gitignore files to this project.
