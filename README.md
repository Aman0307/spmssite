# spmssite

The code for my old business website, more suitably meant for job shops, machine shops, small manufacturers, fabrication workshops, engineering workshops of less than 250 people.

Since I already have a new website, I thought I would release my old website as a template that would help any such business or a startup manufactuerer or machine shop, fabricator, etc. easily launch a website without having to resort to using WordPress Divi theme/temlplate

I always meant to make this also into a Wordpress template.
